title: Seats bookings widget for the website with canvas
layout: demo_page
---

This is a prototype version of seats reservation system I made for one of my clients.

Please read [Full Blog Post](https://lavrton.com/case-study-seat-reservation-widget/) about the process of making the widget.

The widget is made with `React`, `Konva` and `react-konva` libraries.

It is not required to use `React` for such widgets. But it was used here because the main application (where the widget was used) is made with `React`.
