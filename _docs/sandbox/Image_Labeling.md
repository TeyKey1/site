title: Drawing Labels on Image with canvas
layout: demo_page
---

This is a prototype version of image labeling system I made for one of my clients.

Please read [Full Blog Post](https://lavrton.com/case-study-image-labeling-for-machine-learning/) about the process of making the prototype.

The widget is made with `React`, `Konva` and `react-konva` libraries.

It is not required to use `React` for such apps. But it was used here because the main application (where the system was used) is made with `React`.
