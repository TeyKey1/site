title: How to automatically scroll stage by edge drag?
layout: demo_page

If you're looking to enhance your Konva.js application's user experience, implementing an auto-scroll feature is a great way to go. This functionality is especially useful in interactive UIs where users need to drag items or navigate large canvases. By enabling the scroll to automatically move when a user drags an item to the bottom or right edge of the viewport, you create a smoother and more intuitive interaction.

Instructions: Start dragging of any shape. Drag it near corder of the stage. Stage will start scrolling.
