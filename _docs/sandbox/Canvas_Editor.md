## Do you need a design editor for your web app?

This is a demonstration of full canvas editor made with Konva. The demo is made by https://polotno.dev SDK.

`Polotno` is a very opinionated JavaScript framework that built on top of `Konva` and `React`. You can make logos, presentations, designs for social media with it. [polotno.dev](https://polotno.dev/) supports all the basic editing of designs on web: texts, images, filters, selection, transformations, filters, exports, undo/redo and many more.

You can easily integrate Polotno SDK into your web app and make your own design editor.
