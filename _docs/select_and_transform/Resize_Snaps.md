title: HTML5 Canvas Shape Resize Snapping

---

In some application, you may want to snap rotation near some values. Snapping makes a shape "sticky" near provided values and works like rounding.
You can control anchor position behavior with [anchorDragBoundFunc](https://konvajs.org/api/Konva.Transformer.html#anchorDragBoundFunc__anchor) method.

```js
transformer.anchorDragBoundFunc(function (oldAbsPos, newAbsPos, event) {
  // limit any another position on the x axis
  return {
    x: 0,
    y: newAbsolutePosition.y,
  };
});
```

In the demo we will try to implement snapping for resizing. There are many implementations possible.

**Instructions: Try to resize a shape. You will see how transformer is trying to snap to guide lines.**
