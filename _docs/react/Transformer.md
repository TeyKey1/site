title: How to resize and rotate canvas shapes with react and konva?
layout: react_page
---

Currently there is no good, pure declarative "react-way" to use the Transformer tool.
But you can still use it with some small manual requests to the Konva nodes.
And it will work just fine.

The Idea: you need to create a `Konva.Transformer` node, and attach it to the required node manually.

Instructions: Click on one of the shapes to select it.
