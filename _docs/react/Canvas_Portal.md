title: How to use portals in react-konva?
layout: react_page

---

## How does react-konva control the zIndex?

`react-konva` strictly follows the order of elements in the way that you define them in your render. For more info take a look into the [zIndex demo](/docs/react/zIndex.html).

## Is it possible to move a node into another container with `react-konva`?

Currently `react-konva` doesn't support the `React.createPortal` API.

But we can use `<Portal />` component from [react-konva-utils package](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva-utils)

Such a portal can be useful when you want to temporarily move a node into another container. The common use cases are:

1. Move a dragging shape into another layer for better performance
2. Show an element on top of other elements, but still keep it deep down in the components tree

**Instructions: try to drag a rectangle. You will see that it is visible on top, but in render it is still the first element.**
