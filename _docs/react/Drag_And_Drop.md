title: Drag and drop canvas shapes
layout: react_page
---

To enable drag&drop for any node on the canvas you just need to pass the `draggable` property into the component.

When you drag&drop a shape it is recommended to save its position into your app store. You can use the `onDragMove` and `onDragEnd` events for that purpose.
