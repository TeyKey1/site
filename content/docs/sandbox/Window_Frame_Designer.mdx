# HTML5 Canvas Window Frame Designer

This is a demo of a window frame constructor, created as a prototype of a large CAD system. The demo showcases how to build a complex interactive application using React, Konva, and react-konva.

## Features
- Select sections of the window frame
- Split sections into multiple child sections
- Set different sash types for each section
- Interactive visual design
- Real-time updates

## Instructions
1. Click on a section to select it
2. Use the controls to split the selected section horizontally or vertically
3. Choose different sash types for each section
4. Experiment with different window frame designs

## Implementation Details

This demo is built using:
- React for UI components and state management
- Konva for canvas rendering
- react-konva for integrating Konva with React

The application demonstrates several advanced concepts:
1. Tree-like data structures for representing window sections
2. Complex mouse interactions for selection
3. Dynamic shape rendering based on section properties
4. Responsive layout calculations
5. Component composition for reusable UI elements

The complete source code is available in the CodeSandbox demo above. You can explore it to learn how to:
- Structure a complex React application with Konva
- Handle nested interactive shapes
- Manage state for a tree-like structure
- Implement undo/redo functionality
- Create a responsive canvas application

This demo shows how Konva can be used to build sophisticated CAD-like applications with smooth interactions and real-time updates.
