title: Konva Framework Overview
---

## What's Konva?

Konva is an HTML5 Canvas JavaScript framework that extends the 2d context
by enabling canvas interactivity for desktop and mobile applications.

Konva enables high performance animations, transitions, node nesting, layering, filtering,
caching, event handling for desktop and mobile applications, and much more.

## How does it work?

Every thing starts from `Konva.Stage` that contains several user's layers (`Konva.Layer`).

Each layer has two `<canvas>` renderers: a scene renderer and a hit graph renderer.
The scene renderer is what you can see, and the hit graph renderer is a special hidden
canvas that's used for high performance event detection.

Each layer can contain shapes, groups of shapes, or groups of other groups.
The stage, layers, groups, and shapes are virtual nodes, similar to DOM nodes in an HTML page.

Here's an example Node hierarchy:

```
                   Stage
                     |
              +------+------+
              |             |
            Layer         Layer
              |             |
        +-----+-----+     Shape
        |           |
      Group       Group
        |           |
        +       +---+---+
        |       |       |
     Shape   Group    Shape
                |
                +
                |
              Shape
```

All nodes can be styled and transformed.  Although `Konva` has prebuilt shapes available,
such as rectangles, circles, images, sprites, text, lines, polygons, regular polygons, paths, stars, etc.,
you can also create custom shapes by instantiating the Shape class and creating a draw function.

Once you have a stage set up with layers and shapes,
you can bind event listeners, transform nodes, run animations,
apply filters, and much more.

Minimal code example:

```
// first we need to create a stage
var stage = new Konva.Stage({
  container: 'container',   // id of container <div>
  width: 500,
  height: 500
});

// then create layer
var layer = new Konva.Layer();

// create our shape
var circle = new Konva.Circle({
  x: stage.width() / 2,
  y: stage.height() / 2,
  radius: 70,
  fill: 'red',
  stroke: 'black',
  strokeWidth: 4
});

// add the shape to the layer
layer.add(circle);

// add the layer to the stage
stage.add(layer);

// draw the image
layer.draw();
```

## Basic shapes

Konva.js supports  shapes: [Rect](/docs/shapes/Rect.html), [Circle](/docs/shapes/Circle.html), [Ellipse](/docs/shapes/Ellipse.html), [Line](/docs/shapes/Line_-_Simple_Line.html), [Polygon](/docs/shapes/Line_-_Polygon.html), [Spline](/docs/shapes/Line_-_Spline.html), [Blob](/docs/shapes/Line_-_Blob.html), [Image](/docs/shapes/Image.html), [Text](/docs/shapes/Text.html), [TextPath](/docs/shapes/TextPath.html), [Star](/docs/shapes/Star.html), [Label](/docs/shapes/Label.html), [SVG Path](/docs/shapes/Path.html), [RegularPolygon](/docs/shapes/RegularPolygon.html).
 Also you can create [custom shape](/docs/shapes/Custom.html):

```
var triangle = new Konva.Shape({
      sceneFunc: function(context) {
        context.beginPath();
        context.moveTo(20, 50);
        context.lineTo(220, 80);
        context.quadraticCurveTo(150, 100, 260, 170);
        context.closePath();

        // special Konva.js method
        context.fillStrokeShape(this);
      },
      fill: '#00D2FF',
      stroke: 'black',
      strokeWidth: 4
});
```
![Custom shape](/assets/overview-custom.png)

## Styles

Each shape supports the following style properties:
* Fill. Solid color, gradients or images
* Stroke (color, width)
* Shadow (color, offset, opacity, blur)
* Opacity

```
var pentagon = new Konva.RegularPolygon({
    x: stage.width() / 2,
    y: stage.height() / 2,
    sides: 5,
    radius: 70,
    fill: 'red',
    stroke: 'black',
    strokeWidth: 4,
    shadowOffsetX : 20,
    shadowOffsetY : 25,
    shadowBlur : 40,
    opacity : 0.5
});
```

## Events

With `Konva` you can easily listen to user input events (`click`, `dblclick`, `mouseover`, `tap`, `dbltap`, `touchstart` etc),
attributes change events (`scaleXChange`, `fillChange`) and drag&drop events (`dragstart`, `dragmove`, `dragend`).

```
circle.on('mouseout touchend', function() {
    console.log('user input');
});

circle.on('xChange', function() {
    console.log('position change');
});

circle.on('dragend', function() {
    console.log('drag stopped');
});
```
See [working example](/docs/events/Binding_Events.html).

## DRAG AND DROP

`Konva` has builtin drag support. There is no `drop` event, instead use `dragenter`, `dragleave`, and `dragover`.
It is very easy to implement `drop` events [via a framework](/docs/drag_and_drop/Drop_Events.html).

To enable drag&drop just set property draggable = true.

```js
shape.draggable('true');
```

Then you can subscribe to drag&drop events and setup [moving limits](/docs/drag_and_drop/Complex_Drag_and_Drop.html).

## Filters

`Konva` has several filters: blur, invert, noise etc. For all available filters see [Filters API](/api/Konva.Filters.html).

Example:
![Filter](/assets/overview-filter.png)

## Animation

You can create animations in two ways:

1. via `Konva.Animation` [Demo](/docs/animations/Moving.html):
```
var anim = new Konva.Animation(function(frame) {
    var time = frame.time,
        timeDiff = frame.timeDiff,
        frameRate = frame.frameRate;
    // update stuff
}, layer);
anim.start();
```

2. via `Konva.Tween` [Demo](/docs/tweens/Linear_Easing.html):
```
var tween = new Konva.Tween({
        node: rect,
        duration: 1,
        x: 140,
        rotation: Math.PI * 2,
        opacity: 1,
        strokeWidth: 6
});
tween.play();

// or new shorter method:
circle.to({
    duration : 1,
    fill : 'green'
});
```

## Selectors

It is very useful to use searching in elements when you are building large application.
`Konva` helps you to find an element with selectors. You can use `find()` method (returns collection) or `findOne()` method (return first element of collection).
```
var circle = new Konva.Circle({
        radius: 10,
        fill: 'red',
        id : 'face',
        name : 'red circle'
});
layer.add(circle);

// then try to search

// find by type
layer.find('Circle'); // returns array of all circles

// find by id
layer.findOne('#face');

// find by name (like css class)
layer.find('.red')
```

## Serialisation and Deserialization

All created objects you can save as JSON. You may save it to server or local storage.
```
var json = stage.toJSON();
```
Also you can restore objects from JSON:
```
var json = '{"attrs":{"width":578,"height":200},"className":"Stage","children":[{"attrs":{},"className":"Layer","children":[{"attrs":{"x":100,"y":100,"sides":6,"radius":70,"fill":"red","stroke":"black","strokeWidth":4},"className":"RegularPolygon"}]}]}';

var stage = Konva.Node.create(json, 'container');
```

## Performance

`Konva` has a lot of tools to improve speed of your app. Most important methods:

1. Caching allows you to draw an element into buffer canvas. Then draw element from the canvas. It may improve performance a lot for complex nodes such as text or shapes with shadow and strokes.
```
shape.cache();
```
[Demo](/docs/performance/Shape_Caching.html)

2. Layering. As framework supports several `<canvas>` elements you can put objects at your discretion.
For example your application consists from complex background and several moving shapes. You can use one layer for background and another one for shapes.
While updating shapes you don't need to update background canvas. [Demo](/docs/performance/Layer_Management.html)
